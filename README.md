## âš™ Installation
### Prerequisites
The code was developed and tested with Python 3.10 and the main dependencies are [Pytorch == 2.0.0 ](https://pytorch.org/) and [Cuda==11.7](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit)

Set up the environment and then install the dependencies with
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Download and prepare datasets

1. Set the environment variable `DISENTANGLEMENT_TRANSFER_DATA` to this path, for example by adding

```
export DISENTANGLEMENT_TRANSFER_DATA=<path to the data directory>
```
2. Download all the necessary datasets with the script
```
./bash_scripts/download_datasets.sh
```
3. Unzip the compressed files (Coil100 and RGDB Objects)

4. Create the augmented and binary version of Coil100 with the command
```
python create_coil100_augmented/augment_coil100.py
```
## ðŸš€ OMES usage
The code requires `representations.npz` and `classes.csv` to contain the representation and the labels of the FoVs of random samples. Both files are in the same directory, [example folder](example) contains an example of the required files.

Run the following script to compute the **averaged OMES** score over the FoVs:
```
# path to representation without .npz extension
representation_path = os.path.join(<path to representation>, "representations")

 # path to FoVs labels without .csv extension
classes_path = os.path.join(<path to representation>, "classes")


mode = "mean" # representation modality: mu of sampled points of the VAE encoder.

metric_mode = OMES(mode=mode, representation_path=representation_path, classes_path=classes_path)
dict_score = metric_mode.get_score()  # average score over FoVs wrt alpha

with open(os.path.join(representation_path, 'omes.json'), 'w') as fp:
     json.dump(dict_score, fp)
```

Or for the **separated OMES** score for each FoV run:
```
# Score separated for each FoV
metric_mode = OMESFactors(mode=mode, representation_path=representation_path, classes_path=classes_path)
dict_score = metric_mode.get_score()  

with open(os.path.join(representation_path, 'omes_factors.json'), 'w') as fp:
     json.dump(dict_score, fp)
```

## ðŸš€ Train your model

## ðŸ“Š How to reproduce Transfer experiments

To reproduce the experiment of the study use the scripts in the folder 
```
./bash_scripts
```

### Train Source models
The scripts starting with *train_* execute the training of the Source models.

```
bash ./bash_scripts/train_*.sh
```

The results will be saved in `./outuput` directory, organized by _experiment name_ and numbered by the _random seed_.

**Once** one experiment folder is completed aggregate the results of all random seeds with the scripts
```
python dlib_aggregate_results_experiment.py --experiment experiment_name 
```


### Transfer on Target dataset
**Once** you have trained the source models, run the scripts to execute the transfer experiments.

```
bash ./bash_scripts/transfer_*.sh
```

The results will be saved in `./outuput` directory, organized by experiment name:
*source_experiment*\_to\_*target_experiment*

**Once** one experiment folder is completed aggregate the results of all random seeds with the scripts
```
python dlib_aggregate_results_transfer_experiment.py --experiment experiment_name 
```
**Then** to read and save the results of the experiment run
```
python dlib_compare_transfer.py --experiment experiment_name --values_to_aggregate "model_num"
```
